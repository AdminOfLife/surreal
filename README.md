Unreal Tournament
=================

This is a continuation of the original Unreal Tournament engine. It is based
on several parts from different sources:

 * The partial source code release to version 432
   http://unreal.epicgames.com/ (site offline)
 * The OpenUT project
   http://openut.sourceforge.net/
 * Chris Dohnal's work on OpenGLDrv and D3D9Drv
   http://www.cwdohnal.com/utglr/
 * Original work done here.

For now, it is codenamed Surreal.


License situation
-----------------

A copy of the Artistic License is included in LICENSE. This is the license that
OpenUT has used during it's lifetime.

Because I could not find a license in the 432 source code release, with the
exception of the vague guideline in the Help file, I have assumed that both
these official releases are distributed with the Artistic License.

Chris Dohnal has yet to respond to me by email. I'm hoping he will forgive me
for my sins.
